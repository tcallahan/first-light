# first-light
## Purpose
Someone told me that they wouldn't hire a software engineer / architect who didn't have a github account with "original" content.

## Contents
This repo is for storing settings and configurations that I can share between the various systems that I work on.  I work primarily on Mac OS, spending most of my time in an IDE, Linux VM, or ssh'd into a remote host, hence the contents of this repo.

### Homebrew
