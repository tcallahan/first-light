## Purpose
Someone told me that they wouldn't hire a software engineer / architect who didn't have a github account with "original" content.

## Contents
This repo is for storing settings and configurations that I can share between the various systems that I work on.

### Homebrew
Source the .homebrew file into .bashrc when setting up a new mac, after having installed homebrew and run all the brew install commands listed.  These primarily give my Mac the same GNU command line tools as the Linux systems I use daily.
